## I know my code is bad

* That is why this repo exists  

## Cloning the project \(if you want to for some reason\)

To clone the project you can use the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PerryLets/learning-cpp.git
```

### Setup for .vscode/tasks.json \(Linux and MacOS\)

For the VS Code tasks to work, you need to create two folders.

* bin
* bin/debug

To do so, run the following commands on your terminal:

```bash
cd learning-cpp
mkdir bin
mkdir bin/debug
```

You also need to change the tasks to use your preferred compiler.

### Setup for .vscode\\tasks.json \(Windows\)

For the VS Code tasks to work, you need to create two folders.

* bin
* bin\\debug

To do so, run the following commands on your terminal:

```cmd
cd learning-cpp
mkdir bin
mkdir bin\debug
```

You will also need a compiler, which usually isn't included on a Windows machine.

You can follow the tutorial to download a MinGW-x64 for Windows on the [VS Code documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp#_example-install-mingwx64)

After you have the compiler, you can change the tasks to use it.
